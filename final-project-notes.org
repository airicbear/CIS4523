#+TITLE: Notes

* Methodology

- Income is adjusted for inflation

- Dimensionality: retain columns that would affect prediction

- "Occupational prestige" determined through separate studies by sociologists.
  Generally, higher prestige corresponds to professional occupations (e.g., doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.) while lower prestige corresponds to service occupations (e.g., restaurant workers, construction workers, etc.)

* Results

- For training/testing, I found 90/10 performed had slightly higher accuracy (1%) than 75/25

* Conclusion

- Number of children: positive correlation

- Shortcoming:

  - Should've used 70/30 for better generalization

* Comments from professor

- Compare to some baseline

  + Number of features affect prediction

- Address inflation
